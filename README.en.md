# PreppyData
> We provide Data Preprocessing for everybody

## üîç Background & Problem Statement

Current data preprocessing services provide automated or predefined methods, but these tools have several limitations:

### Limitations of Current Data Preprocessing Services

1. **Limited Customization**
   - Restrictions in choosing data encoding methods
   - Limitations in selecting outlier detection techniques
   - Constrained options for feature selection strategies

2. **Generalized Approaches**
   - Application of the same methods across all datasets
   - Uniform processing that does not consider domain-specific characteristics

3. **Lack of User Control**
   - Limited control over the preprocessing steps applied
   - Low transparency in the data transformation process
   - Reduced user understanding of the processing steps

## üí° Our Solution

1. **Selectable Preprocessing Methods**
   - Diverse encoding options (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding)
   - Various outlier detection methods (Z-score, IQR, LOF)
   - Multiple feature selection approaches (Correlation-based, LASSO)

2. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - A platform where users can easily upload data, select desired options, and receive feedback on the applied transformations

3. **High Transparency and Control**
   - A system that allows users to understand preprocessing steps and provides flexibility in making adjustments throughout the process

## ‚≠ê Features
### Core Features
 - [Customizable Preprocessing Options]: Users can choose from various data preprocessing techniques.
 - [User-Friendly Interface]: A simple web-based platform for users to upload datasets and explore available preprocessing options.
