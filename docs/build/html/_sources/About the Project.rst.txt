**PreppyData: Accessible Data Preprocessing for Everyone**

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any data analysis or machine learning project. However, existing data preprocessing services often rely on automated methods or predefined techniques, leading to several limitations:

Limitations of Current Data Preprocessing Services
--------------------------------------------------

1. **Limited Customization**
   - Restricted choices in data encoding methods
   - Limited options for outlier detection techniques
   - Constrained feature selection strategies

2. **Generalized Approaches**
   - Uniform methods applied to all datasets without considering domain-specific characteristics
   - Lack of tailored processing to accommodate unique dataset attributes

3. **Lack of User Control**
   - Minimal control over preprocessing methods applied
   - Low transparency in data transformation processes
   - Decreased understanding of the preprocessing steps

Our Solution
------------

**PreppyData** aims to overcome these limitations by offering:

- **Selectable Preprocessing Methods**
  - Diverse Encoding Options: Choose from one-hot encoding, label encoding, and more
  - Variety in Outlier Detection: Select from Z-score, IQR, Local Outlier Factor (LOF) methods
  - Flexible Feature Selection: Options include correlation-based methods, LASSO regression, and others

- **User-Friendly Interface**
  - An intuitive platform where users can easily upload data
  - Simple selection of desired preprocessing options
  - Real-time feedback on applied transformations

- **High Transparency and Control**
  - Comprehensive understanding of each preprocessing step
  - Flexibility to adjust parameters throughout the process
  - Enhanced transparency to build user confidence in data transformations

Features
--------
